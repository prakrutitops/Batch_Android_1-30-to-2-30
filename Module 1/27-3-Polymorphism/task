B37. Create a class to print the area of a square and a rectangle. The class has two methods with the
same name but different number of parameters. The method for printing area of a rectangle has two
parameters which are length and breadth respectively while the other method for printing area of
square has one parameter which is side of square.

B38. Create a class with a method that prints “This is a parent class” and its subclass with another
method that prints “This is child class”. Now, create an object for each of the class and call
1 - method of parent class by object of parent class
2 - method of child class by object of child class
3 - method of parent class by object of child class

B39. Create a class named ‘Member’ having the following members:
Data members1 - Name
2 - Age
3 - Phone number
4 - Address
5 - Salary
It also has a method named ‘printSalary’ which prints the salary of the members.
Two classes ‘Employee’ and ‘Manager’ inherits the ‘Member’ class. The ‘Employee’ and ‘Manager’
classes have data members ‘specialization’ and ‘department’ respectively. Now, assign name, age,
phone number, address and salary to an employee and a manager by making an object of both of
these classes and print the same.

B40. Create a class named Rectangle with two data members length and breadth and two methods to
print the area and perimeter of the rectangle respectively. Its constructor having parameters for
length and breadth is used to initialize the length and breadth of the rectangle. Let class Square
inherit the Rectangle class with its constructor having a parameter for its side (suppose s) calling the
constructor of its parent class as ‘super (s, s)’. Print the area and perimeter of a rectangle and a
square.
